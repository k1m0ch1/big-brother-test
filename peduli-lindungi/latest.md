# PeduliLindungi v3.4.6

Because of the data leak eHac, the "feature" of the eHac is moved to this Application, so people will always be catius to install any application that include KTP, photo, name or phone for register requirement.

So here the [PeduliLindungi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.telkom.tracencare&hl=en&gl=US) mobile app, currently available for android and iphone.

I do check the apps and I'm not doing full analyze, because there is so many source that I need to analyze, probably this is enough, So here is what I found

## CPU, Storage and RAM is stored on firebase <a name="stored-resources"></a>

This data will be recorded and stored at firebase peduli lindungi
```
NAME, LOGGED_WHEN, DEVICE_TYPE, CPU, STORAGE, RAM
```

the data will be sent to firebase (manually by application) when you are trying to ~~login,~~ register, verify login and verify register

why they need the CPU, Storage and RAM, what for ?

2. `/data/user/0/com.telkom.tracencare/files/google_app_measurement.db`
3. `data/user/0/com.telkom.tracencare/databases/Rtf9Lv2ZmH7r ` store file SQLite

## SQLite

Table

`room_master_table`
- identity_hash

`Mkv8la9Kpa`
- uid
- PfRla7pqHv5

inside this table stored data like this

```

berbeda dengan firebase crashlytic, ini di encode ke base64, dan valuenya di encode ke base64

kenapa nyimpen data activity kaya gini (?)

`room_table_modification_log`

`events`

`user_attributes`
- name
- set_timestamp
- value
- origin
- app_id
- rowid

`messages`
- rowid
- type
- entry

`apps`

## Save a file that contain auth session


## Force close application on mock location <a name="exit-onmock-location"></a>

there is some detection that the application will force close if you mock the location with the other tools

## ~~Locally saved location on your device~~ Removed in version 3.4.6+ <a name="location-sqlite"></a>

This data is stored into sqlite (a file that contain specific information into local device, usually hackers will do everything to get the legit information as many as possible)

## Some page will store your access token <a name="store-access-token"></a>

when you want to access the feature "List Faskses Vaksinasi Mandiri" you will redirected to page `https://www.pedulilindungi.id/faskes` and store `access_token` to the local storage, it meant your access token is stored locally on the browser `WebView`

## Some of the URL is visible at source code<a name="url-visible"></a>

when we check the decompiled application, its easy to see all the URL included the main feature of the application

## Old feature is not deleted <a name="old-feature"></a>

some of the old feature is still on the apps
